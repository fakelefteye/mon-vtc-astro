                <p>After several rewarding years in the IT sector, where <strong>precision</strong>, <strong>logic</strong>, and <strong>problem-solving</strong> were my daily routine, I decided to shift my career towards a service-oriented profession with human contact: a <strong>private driver (VTC)</strong>.</p>
                                
                <p>This technical background has given me a <strong>rigor</strong> and a <strong>sense of organization</strong> that I now put at your service. For me, a successful trip is not just about getting from point A to point B. It's a complete experience: <strong>absolute punctuality</strong>, anticipating your needs, <strong>guaranteed discretion</strong>, and a smooth, safe drive.</p>
