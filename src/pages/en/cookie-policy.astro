        This cookie policy explains how **ShipCars** (hereinafter referred to as "we", "our", "us") uses cookies and similar technologies on its website `transfert-aeroport-grenoble.fr`.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What is a cookie?</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. It allows the site to "remember" your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and other display settings) over a period of time, so you don't have to re-enter them each time you return to the site or navigate from one page to another.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Types of cookies we use</h2>
      <p>Our website primarily uses **strictly necessary cookies**:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          **Functional/Technical Cookies:** These cookies are essential for the proper functioning of our website and to allow you to use its basic features, such as navigation, accessing secure areas of the site, and managing your reservation session (e.g., to retain the information you entered in the reservation form between steps). Without these cookies, the site would not be able to function correctly. They do not collect any personally identifiable information and do not require your consent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>We do NOT use (unless otherwise indicated in the future with your explicit consent):</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          **Analytics/Performance Cookies:** These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website (e.g., most visited pages, error messages). Currently, we do not use third-party services like Google Analytics that would require your consent for these cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Advertising/Targeting Cookies:** These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. We do not use such cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Social Media Cookies:** These cookies are used to allow you to share our site's content on social networks. We do not use such cookies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Consent</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with current legislation (GDPR and CNIL guidelines), cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the service you request do not require your prior consent. Since our site only uses cookies of this type, we do not display a cookie consent banner.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we decide in the future to use other types of cookies (analytics, advertising), we will update this policy and implement a mechanism to collect your consent.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Managing Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        You have control over cookies. You can configure your browser at any time to accept or refuse cookies, or to be notified when cookies are sent. Most web browsers offer options to manage cookies in their settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that blocking strictly necessary cookies may affect the proper functioning of our website and prevent you from using some of its features.
